  "description": "TThis extension is a simple todo list that allows you to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. It stores the tasks in the browser's local storage so that they are available even when the extension is closed. You can also add the URL of the current tab as a task by clicking the add button without entering any text in the input field. If a todo item is a URL, it will open a new tab to the destination of the URL when clicked twice.",
